# medical-question-answering-chatbot
This project is a specialized medical question-answering chatbot built using the MedQuAD dataset provided by the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM). It leverages semantic search with sentence-transformers and medical entity recognition using SciSpacy, enabling users to ask natural-language questions and receive relevant medical answers.
